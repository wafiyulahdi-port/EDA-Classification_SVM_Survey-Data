# EDA-Classification_SVM_Survey Data
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and classification project using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on survey data. The analysis explores data patterns, feature distributions, and relationships before applying SVM for predictive modeling. The classifier performed strongly, achieving an accuracy of 94%. This is 2023 project
